Super fast remote editing with Vim
==================================
### (Vim+Netrw+SSH tunnel)

I started using Vim last month, was using scp (netrw plugin). It was so slow on a 2G connection.

I was searching for a solution, and I found something that changes everything. check [Fast Remote Editing With Vim](http://www.erikzaadi.com/2013/03/07/fast-remote-editing-with-vim/)

I tried to auto start and stop ssh tunnel with vim autocmd. check this gist

Remote editing over Vim is super fast now. check my .vimrc for more hacks-
