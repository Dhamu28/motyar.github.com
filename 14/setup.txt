My development setup
======================
Note to self, but can help others.
---------------------------------


### Server
I own a Digital ocean [VPS](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=34a8a2d54244).

VPS have installed LAMP on Ubuntu.

### Local

Installed Ubuntu.

Enabled login with keys:-

    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh username@VPS_IP_ADD 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'

These few rows in `.ssh/config`:-

    host vps

        hostname VPS_IP_ADD

        user username

        Compression yes

        Ciphers blowfish-cbc,arcfour

        ControlMaster auto

        ControlPath /tmp/%r@%h:%


Installed `Vim` and here is my latest `.vimrc`:-

[https://github.com/motyar/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc](https://github.com/motyar/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc)

Editing files with Vim Scp. Use **path to folder** to see the Explorer:-

    vim scp://vps/path_to_dir/

Thats all for now.
