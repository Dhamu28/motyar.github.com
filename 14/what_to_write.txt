What to write?
==============
Yes, write even if you have no idea.
------------------------------------
I just thought about **I should write**, But I had no idea.

What should I write about? and I got an idea. 

Think about what you have learned today? or What you want to learn? Or ask What you want to know.

Your ideas may feel very (Obvious to you but they may be Amazing to others)[http://sivers.org/obvious].

So just open your editor, start writing and hit publish.

See I just created a blog post using the same idea.

Thanks for reading.
