How to Update Github hosted static website
==========================================
By just typing a single command
-------------------------------
I have moved few of my websites to ***Github Pages***. Check the [blog post about it](http://motyar.github.io/14/free_hosting_on_github.html) In this post we are talking about **how to update** these sites.

Here are few steps:

* You need to clone the repo, only the gh-pages branch.

    git clone git@github.com:username/domain.com.git -b gh-pages

* Edit, Remove or Add files and data you want to.

* Create a new file named 'update' with these contents

    git add -A . 
    git commit -m "Updated" 
    git push origin gh-pages
* Give it permissions by runing this command

    chmod +x update
* Run this script

    ./update

* Done, Updated!!
