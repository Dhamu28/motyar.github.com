When to use kill -9
===================
Why you should use *kill -15* before *kill -9*
----------------------------------------------

Every time when I have to hardkill a process I use *kill -9 PID*. But from [unix.stackexchange.com](http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/8918) 

> Generally, you should use *kill* -15 before *kill -9* to give the target process a chance to clean up after itself. If you don't give the process a chance to finish what it's doing and clean up, it may leave corrupted files (or other state) around that it won't be able to understand once restarted.)
